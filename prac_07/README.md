# Practical 07
# About This Repository
This repository contains the practical exercises and projects I made for the CP1404 course. It serves as a place for me to practice programming concepts, improve my programming skills, and complete assignments related to software development.

# About Me
Hello! I am Lin Yan, a student passionate about programming and software development. Through these practicals, I am learning how to write cleaner, more maintainable code and apply best practices.

# Lessons Learned About Clean Code
1. Writing meaningful and descriptive variable and function names improves code readability.
2. Keeping functions short and focused on a single task helps improve maintainability and testability.
3. Consistent formatting and indentation makes code easier to understand and debug.
