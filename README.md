# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404 

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each ... with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates
Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was mixed at first: some tasks took longer than expected due to unexpected debugging or figuring out unfamiliar concepts, while others were quicker than I thought.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Over time, I have become increasingly skilled at breaking down tasks and identifying which parts will be time-consuming. I then allocate more time for the difficult parts. I am also better at incorporating testing and debugging time into my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I have learned how to more accurately assess the complexity of tasks, gain a clearer understanding of key points, and manage my time better. Estimating also makes me pay more attention to my way of working, allowing me to improve it further.


## Code Reviews
### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Code review is a way for classmates to communicate and learn from each other. It helps me notice some issues I had previously overlooked, teaches me more concise and effective ways to write code, and also brings classmates closer together.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
By reviewing others' code, I have discovered some common issues. While pointing out others' problems, I can deepen my understanding of the knowledge and improve my own coding style.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1
https://github.com/HuBohong/cp1404practicals/pull/4
### Explanation
I affirmed the parts he did well and also analyzed the structure of the code. I gave an overall evaluation of Kivy.

### Good Code Review 2
https://github.com/HuBohong/cp1404practicals/pull/3
### Explanation
This review included constructive feedback on consistency in code formatting, logic flow improvements, and encouraging the use of constants instead of magic numbers. And I also acknowledged what was done well to keep the feedback balanced.

# Practicals
## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I will add some short videos or charts to explain the connection between these tasks and real-world programming scenarios, helping students gain a better understanding of the code. In addition, more peer code review opportunities can be included in the weekly exercises.

## What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I was initially not very familiar with programming, but after practicing, I am able to write well-structured code and carefully follow task instructions. In addition, I complete my weekly work on time and actively participate in code reviews.
